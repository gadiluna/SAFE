What is SAf(E)?
-------------

**SAFE** is a **S**elf-**A**ttentive neural network that takes as input a binary **F**unction and creates an **E**mbedding.

What is an embedding?
-------------
 An embedding is vector of real numbers. The nice feature of SAFE embeddings is that two similar binary functions should generate two embeddings
 that are close in the metric space.

 I want to know all the details!
-------------
Good, read our paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05296).
 
The paper is slightly amusing! How do I get SAFE?
------------- 
SAFE is available in our [GitHub](https://github.com/gadiluna/SAFE) repository. Keep in mind that SAFE has been developed as a research project. We only provide a minimal working proof-of-concept,
with the code and data to replicate our experiments. We are not responsible for any self-harm episode correlated with reading our (sometimes badly written) code.

How I can get involved with SAFE?
------------- 
If you are interested in this project write us an email.
